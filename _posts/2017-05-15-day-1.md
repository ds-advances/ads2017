  title: Automating Machine Learning
  institute: University of Cambridge and Uber AI
  url: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/
  abstract: "Machine learning is the field concerned with designing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. Ironically, machine learning systems are currently hand-built by experts in a slow, laborious and error-prone manner. I will describe three directions of research which aim to truly automate machine learning: the Automatic Statistician; Turing: a new Probabilistic Programming language based on Julia; and the rational allocation of computational resources."

  title: "Computational Privacy: The privacy bounds of human behavior"
  institute: Imperial College London
  url: http://www.demontjoye.com/
  abstract: We're living in an age of big data, a time when most of our movements and actions are collected and stored in real time. Large-scale mobile phone, credit card, or browsing datasets dramatically increase our capacity to measure, understand, and potentially affect the behavior of individuals and collectives. The use of this data, however, raise legitimate privacy concerns. In this talk, I will first show how the mere absence of obvious identifiers such as name or phone number is often not enough to prevent re-identification. I will then discuss how, as the use of this data progress, it will become increasingly important to consider whether sensitive information can be inferred from apparently innocuous data. Finally, I will discuss the impact of metadata on society and some of solutions we are developing to allow behavioral metadata to be used in a privacy-conscientious way.

  title: Secure Multi-Party Linear Regression on High-Dimensional Data
  institute: Amazon Research
  url: http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~deballep/
  abstract: The goal of secure multi-pary computation (MPC) is to facilitate the evaluation of functionalities that depend on the private inputs of several distrusting parties in a privacy preserving manner. I will start my talk by discussing potential applications of secure MPC to machine learning and the relation between MPC and other well-known privacy frameworks like differential privacy. Then I will present our recent work on secure MPC protocols for linear regression on distributed databases. By combining several tools from the MPC literature we obtain scalable solutions that can solve problems with millions of records and hundreds of features in a matter of minutes. Some crucial implementation details will be discussed, including the role of fixed-point arithmetic and a robust conjugate gradient descent solver for private linear systems. An implementation of our protocols based on the Obliv-C framework is available as open source.
