  abstract: Machine learning is the field concerned with designing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. Ironically, machine learning systems are currently hand-built by experts in a slow, laborious and error-prone manner. I will describe three directions of research which aim to truly automate machine learning: the Automatic Statistician; Turing: a new Probabilistic Programming language based on Julia; and the rational allocation of computational resources.
