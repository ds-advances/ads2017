  title: "Enabling open science and data science via software: scikit-learn"
  institute: INRIA

  abstract: "Data science, with sophisticated data processing, is having a
transformational impact on many facets of science and society. It is
driven by a technological revolution based on statistical models, and
software implementing them. Outreach, bridging the technical gap outside
of the ivory tower of research lab and high-margin tech ventures, is
crucial to see data-science applications of the beaten track. Scikit-learn is a machine-learning software that strives to reach many
users and applications. Via the rich Python data ecosystem it can be
embedded any domain or workflow. It has hundreds of thousands of users in
a variety of field in the industry or in academia. I will discuss how we
built scikit-learn to be easy-to-use and didactic; how we grew a
community of open-source developers with a focus on collaboration; how we
ensure quality in a statistical-learning codebase; how we try to distill
the most important progress from the rapid pace of academic publishing;
and how we are struggling to make the development sustainable."
